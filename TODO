1.	Parse through considering things as options until you encounter
	either a "--" or an incorrect option, which will be considered,
	along with every subsequent argument, as a file/directory/operand
	1.1	valid options include for the moment(subject to change)
		-l
		-a
		-r
		-R
		-t
		-lartR
		will accept any number of each, though more will not change
		behavior of program, ex:
			-lllaarrrttrRR

2.	Sort between folders/files, if multiple operands are given,
	put files before folders in display, should organise an array
	from the start.

3. run function on all valid elements of array one by one.
