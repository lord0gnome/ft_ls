Todays menu:
Make my LS -R option get the EXACT same results as the original
and understand why it isn't doing so right now.

1.	Parse through considering things as options until you encounter
	either a "--" or an incorrect option, which will be considered,
	along with every subsequent argument, as a file/directory/operand
	1.1	valid options include for the moment(subject to change)
		-l
		-a
		-r
		-R
		-t
		-lartR
		will accept any number of each, though more will not change
		behavior of program, ex:
			-lllaarrrttrRR
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
2.	Sort between folders/files, if multiple operands are given,
	put files before folders in display, should organise an array
	from the start.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
3.	Make sure we're properly appending and trimming the current working
	directory from the current path for all calls.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
4.	Need to read the whole dir from opendir, then close it and
	start on the other directories.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
5.	NEED TO REMOVE ALL HARDCODED CRAP
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
6.	Need to find lost items when sorting
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
7.	Need to avoid invisible files if we're not using -a flag when sorting
